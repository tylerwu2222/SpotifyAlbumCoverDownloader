Instructions for Use

--------------------

1) extract AlbumCoverDL.zip-> run AlbumCoverDL.exe

2) It may take a few seconds for the app to start, after starting, it will ask you to log in to spotify (this is so the app has access to Spotify Web API to pull albums)

3)After logging in, copy the redirected URL into the console and press ENTER (it should look like https://www.google.com/?code ...)

4) The rest of the instructions appear in the application

(Note the app will generate images in the same directory as the application, so feel free to move the app around to where itâ€™s convenient,
HOWEVER, please move the spotify_icon_white.ico file with it, otherwise it will not run)
